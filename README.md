![Uploading image.png…]()


📌 1. Project Description

This project focuses on applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification and Linear Regression to the well-known Iris dataset. The goal is to explore how these machine learning techniques can be used to classify flower species and analyze relationships between features.

The project includes:

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset.

✅ Classification of Iris species using the KNN model.

✅ Predicting relationships between numerical features using Linear Regression.

✅ Implementing these models using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

📂 2. The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used for pattern recognition and contains 150 observations of iris flowers, categorized into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

🌿 Features in the Dataset:

Feature Name

Description

Sepal Length

Length of the sepal in cm

Sepal Width

Width of the sepal in cm

Petal Length

Length of the petal in cm

Petal Width

Width of the petal in cm

Species

Class label (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🤖 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

🔹 How KNN Works:

KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification.

It classifies data points based on the majority class of its 'K' nearest neighbors.

Distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) are used to measure proximity between points.

🔹 Application in This Project:

The KNN model is trained using Sepal and Petal dimensions to classify Iris species.

Hyperparameter 'K' (number of neighbors) is optimized for better accuracy.

Model evaluation is performed using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

📈 4. Linear Regression Model

🔹 Why Use Linear Regression?

Linear regression helps find relationships between numerical variables.

It predicts one feature based on another (e.g., Petal Length vs. Petal Width).

🔹 Application in This Project:

Simple Linear Regression is applied to analyze relationships between petal/sepal dimensions.

The model estimates regression coefficients (slope & intercept).

Performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

🛠️ 5. How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

📊 6. Key Insights from the Analysis

After running the models, the following insights were obtained:
✅ KNN achieves high accuracy in classifying Iris species, with optimal K value.

✅ Petal dimensions show strong correlation, making them reliable predictors for classification.

✅ Linear Regression successfully models relationships between petal/sepal features.

✅ Setosa is the most distinct species, whereas Versicolor and Virginica have overlapping feature distributions.

These insights demonstrate the power of machine learning in pattern recognition and predictive modeling.

📌 7. Conclusion
